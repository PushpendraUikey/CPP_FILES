# CPP_FILES

This repository includes a collection of C++ code developed during my learning phase, organized by topic to streamline the study and practice of core C++ programming concepts. Each directory focuses on a specific area, providing exercises and examples.

## Directory Structure

- **Array**: Programs covering array manipulation, searching, sorting, and multi-dimensional arrays.
- **Composition&Inheritance**: Examples and exercises related to object-oriented programming, focusing on class composition, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Functions**: Programs demonstrating function usage, including function overloading, recursion, and inline functions.
- **HackerRank**: Solutions to challenges from HackerRank, applying C++ knowledge to solve a range of problems.
- **Makefiles**: Contains examples of makefiles, showing how to compile multi-file C++ projects efficiently.
- **Pointers**: Covers pointer operations, pointer arithmetic, dynamic memory allocation, and pointers with arrays.
- **String**: Programs dealing with string manipulation, character arrays, and using C++’s `std::string` library.

## Getting Started

To run these codes:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CPP_FILES.git
   ```
2. Navigate to any directory and compile a file using:
   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o output
   ./output
   ```

## Purpose

This repository serves as a reference for core C++ concepts and a toolkit for foundational programming skills. It’s an ideal resource for beginners and intermediate learners aiming to reinforce their knowledge.
