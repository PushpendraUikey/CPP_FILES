HELMHOLTZ COILS

AIM:- 
(a) To measure the magnetic field produced by the Helmholtz coil.
(b) To determine the torque produced by a current-carrying loop, suspended between the Helmholtz coils as a function of:
    (i) The strength of the magnetic moment(by varying current 'i' through the loop).
    (ii) The angle (alpha) between the magnetic field and the axis of the loop.
    (iii) The number of turns(n) in the current loop.

APPARATUS:- 
(a) Helmholtz coils, digital Gaussmeter, Hall probe.
(b) Torsion dynamometer, power supply with in-built digital ammeter, connecting wires, supporting stand, and two small coils having n=1 and 3.


THEORY:- Helmholtz coil consists of a pair of identical coils(each having N number of turns and radius R) placed coaxially and separated by a distance R. Such a pair produces a fairly uniform magnetic field B. in the region between the two coils provided the sense of current 'I' through the coils are such that the two magnetic fields add.
                                 |B| = 8/5sqrt(5) U.NI/R

In the laboratory set R = 0.2 m, N = 154, and 'I' may be varied up to 3A. U.= 4PI X 10^-7 Henry/meter. When a current (il) carrying conducting loop of radius r with n turns is placed in the uniform magnetic field B between the Helmholtz coils, it experiences a nonzero angle 'alpha' with B. The magnetic moment of the loop is m, where
                   |m| = PI r^2 i_l            Torque = M X B,

Experimentally the torque experienced by the coil transfers to a torque on the lever arm, which can be measured directly from the force experienced by a dynamometer. 
                                 |T| = |F|L
where F is the force measured (in mN) by the force indication knob of the dynamometer and L is the half length of the lever arm(L = 12 cm). The angle between F and L is 90 degrees.

PRECAUTION:- 
1) While connecting and changing the circuit, the power supply must be switched off. If at any time, the red light on the power supply glows( indicating overload ), immediately switch off the power supply and check for any possibility of a short circuit.

2) Make sure that no other magnetic material is placed in the vicinity of the coils. While measuring the magnetic field.

3) Align the lever arms very carefully it is very delicate and should be handled with extreme care.

4) Rotate the force indication knob very carefully, while measuring the deflection on torsion dynamometer.
